** Resumption of MCT development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:39f6904b-a045-4539-aa66-76be822064f9
:END:

In April 2022, I announced that I was discontinuing the development of
my ~mct~ package.  At the time, Emacs 29 was gaining new MCT-like
capabilities and I thought we would quickly reach a point where my
package would be superseded by built-in functionality.  The article I
published at the time:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-04-14-emacs-discontinue-mct/>.

About a year later and after receiving questions about MCT, I decided
to restart its development.  This was done in light of the realisation
that the built-in Emacs functionality was still not as opinionated as
MCT.  There are good reasons for this state of affairs, due to the
legacy of this important User Interface element and Emacs' policy to
not break stuff willy nilly.  Still, the fact remains that MCT can fit
in a very narrow niche for those who (i) like the built-in completions
and (ii) appreciate a few extra niceties.  What I wrote in March, 2023:
<https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-03-25-emacs-restart-mct-development/>.

What does MCT offer that the built-in Emacs UI does not?  In short:

- MCT provides a facility for "live completions", to automatically
  update the =*Completions*= buffer given certain conditions.  A
  number of user options control the specifics.

- There are user options for a passlist and blocklist, which determine
  what should automatically display the =*Completions*= buffer and be
  live updated.  The passlist and the blocklist can target individual
  commands, such as ~find-file~, as well as completion categories like
  ~buffer~.  The manual includes a section with several known
  completion categories.

To be clear: MCT builds on top of the built-in functionality and
should not compete with it.  Depending on my availability, I will try
to prepare patches for emacs.git to see whether at least some features
can be added directly to =mnibuffer.el= or related.

** MCT supports Emacs 29 or higher
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6ee9aea9-91f3-47cf-aab3-984fe9e23157
:END:

MCT is highly opinionated about how the completions should work.  This
applies to the presentation of the completion candidates as well as
the behaviour of commands that cycle between the minibuffer and the
=*Completions*=, treating the two as a contiguous space.  In previous
versions of Emacs, MCT could not work exactly as intended due to
limitations in the underlying framework.  For example, the variable
~completions-format~ gained the ~one-column~ value only in Emacs 28:
Emacs 27 supported grid views which are not intuitive as a vertical
list for up-down cycling between the candidates.

To make things easier to maintain, MCT only works with Emacs 29 or
higher.  The ~1 year hiatus has hopefully given users enough time to
assess their options.

** Deprecation of ~mct-region-mode~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:bf50160c-07e9-4625-af0a-5142d79ed35b
:END:

For a while, MCT supported in-buffer completion via a minor mode that
would add all the needed functionality.  This was always problematic
due to underlying constrains and is thus no longer supported.  MCT is
designed to work exclusively with the minibuffer, where the behaviour
is more reliable.

Nevertheless, users can still get an MCT-like experience with these
settings, which affect the default UI (modify as you see fit):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Define the small wrapper functions
(defun my-mct-next-line-or-completion (n)
  "Select next completion or move to next line N times.
Select the next completion if `completion-in-region-mode' is
active and the Completions window is on display."
  (interactive "p")
  (if (and completion-in-region-mode (mct--get-completion-window))
      (minibuffer-next-completion n)
    (next-line n)))

(defun my-mct-previous-line-or-completion (n)
  "Select previous completion or move to previous line N times.
Select the previous completion if `completion-in-region-mode' is
active and the Completions window is on display."
  (interactive "p")
  (if (and completion-in-region-mode (mct--get-completion-window))
      (minibuffer-previous-completion n)
    (previous-line n)))

(defun my-mct-return-or-choose-completion (n)
  "Choose current completion or create N newlines.
Choose the current completion if `completion-in-region-mode' is
active and the Completions window is on display."
  (interactive "p")
  (if (and completion-in-region-mode (mct--get-completion-window))
      (minibuffer-choose-completion)
    (newline n :interactive)))

;; Get the key bindings
(let ((map completion-in-region-mode-map))
  (define-key map (kbd "C-n") #'my-mct-next-line-or-completion)
  (define-key map (kbd "C-p") #'my-mct-previous-line-or-completion)
  (define-key map (kbd "RET") #'my-mct-return-or-choose-completion))

;; Tweak the appearance
(setq completions-format 'one-column)
(setq completion-show-help nil)
(setq completion-auto-help t)

;; Optionally, tweak the appearance further
(setq completions-detailed t)
(setq completion-show-inline-help nil)
(setq completions-max-height 6)
(setq completions-highlight-face 'completions-highlight)
#+end_src

** The ~mct-minibuffer-mode~ is renamed to ~mct-mode~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:d93fc6b9-3b21-4072-91d3-29a51d8f26f3
:END:

The ~mct-mode~ was the original name, which was later given the
"minibuffer" specifier to disambiguate it from the aforementioned
~mct-region-mode~.  With the latter gone, this qualification is no
longer pertinent and the original name can be restored.

** The ~completing-read-multiple~ indicator has been removed
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:03b4eae8-fda2-42d4-aaf7-ad87e5211725
:END:

Previous versions of MCT would prepend a =[CRM]= tag to the minibuffer
prompt of commands powered by ~completing-read-multiple~.  While this
is a nice usability enhancement, it is not specific to MCT and thus
should not be part of =mct.el=.  Use this in your init file instead:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Add prompt indicator to `completing-read-multiple'.  We display
;; [`completing-read-multiple': <separator>], e.g.,
;; [`completing-read-multiple': ,] if the separator is a comma.  This
;; is adapted from the README of the `vertico' package by Daniel
;; Mendler.  I made some small tweaks to propertize the segments of
;; the prompt.
(defun crm-indicator (args)
  (cons (format "[`crm-separator': %s]  %s"
                (propertize
                 (replace-regexp-in-string
                  "\\`\\[.*?]\\*\\|\\[.*?]\\*\\'" ""
                  crm-separator)
                 'face 'error)
                (car args))
        (cdr args)))

(advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :filter-args #'crm-indicator)
#+end_src

** No more IDO-like file navigation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4cf5c77c-d991-4a7a-b59c-06f1cf67317b
:END:

Older versions of MCT had a command for file navigation that would
delete the whole directory component before point, effectively going
back up one directory.  While the functionality can be useful, it is not
integral to the MCT experience and thus should not belong in =mct.el=.
Add this to your own configuration file instead:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Adaptation of `icomplete-fido-backward-updir'.
(defun my-backward-updir ()
  "Delete char before point or go up a directory."
  (interactive nil mct-mode)
  (cond
   ((and (eq (char-before) ?/)
         (eq (mct--completion-category) 'file))
    (when (string-equal (minibuffer-contents) "~/")
      (delete-minibuffer-contents)
      (insert (expand-file-name "~/"))
      (goto-char (line-end-position)))
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (1- (point)))
      (when (search-backward "/" (minibuffer-prompt-end) t)
        (delete-region (1+ (point)) (point-max)))))
   (t (call-interactively 'backward-delete-char))))

(define-key minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map (kbd "DEL") #'my-backward-updir)
#+end_src

** Lots of changes under the hood
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ab0091bf-cbd1-4453-a674-66c195a95622
:END:

I do not intend to refashion MCT.  It works the way it was originally
intended to.  What I did is to streamline the code for compatibility
with Emacs 29 and tweak the custom commands to preserve the desired
cyclic behaviour between the minibuffer and the =*Completions*=.

Experiments such as integration with the ~avy~ package or the ability
to type-to-complete in the =*Completions*= buffer are abandoned.

Do not expect radical changes henceforth.  I shall monitor and/or
contribute to developments in core Emacs and am happy to forever
archive MCT if/when the default completion UI gains the capabilities
that, I think, make the user experience a little bit easier.

* Version 0.5.0 on 2022-02-08
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c8d8ad3a-06c9-445d-a4e7-11a68ee17df1
:END:

This entry covers the changes made to the "Minibuffer and Completions in
Tandem" (=mct= package) since the release of [[#h:1f8fc960-4e4b-4bb1-a1c4-5083f287a28c][version 0.4.0 on 2022-01-19]].
There have been about 60 commits in the meantime.

For further details on the user-facing options covered herein, please
read the manual: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct>.  Or evaluate the
following expression if you already have =mct= installed:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Customisation options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:95aca1ab-ce8a-4187-94ee-430d44a321b1
:END:

*** Size of the Completions buffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1b49d3f4-be28-4c6e-a1cb-a473eb87f611
:END:

The user option ~mct-completion-window-size~ controls the maximum and
minimum height of the window where the =*Completions*= buffer is shown.
It accepts a cons cell in the form of =(MAX-HEIGHT . MIN-HEIGHT)=.  Valid
values are natural numbers (positive integers) or functions which return
such numbers.  The default is a combination of the two for the sake of
illustration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq mct-completion-window-size (cons #'mct--frame-height-fraction 1))
#+end_src

With this in place, mct will let the =*Completions*= grow up to 1/3 of the
frame's height (per the ~mct--frame-height-fraction~).  When live
completion is performed (see the user option ~mct-live-completion~), the
window will shrink to fit the candidates.

To make the =*Completions*= have a fixed height instead, simply set the
same number/function twice.

If set to nil, mct will simply not try to fit the Completions' buffer to
its window.

Thanks to Daniel Mendler for the feedback in issue 14:

*** Passlist and blocklist accept completion categories
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:cc1102ca-0a3f-4b34-84e0-c5d684a4c37e
:END:

The user options ~mct-completion-passlist~ and ~mct-completion-blocklist~
used to only match symbols of commands like ~find-file~, whereas now they
can affect any completion category such as ~file~, ~kill-ring~, et cetera.

Sample code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This is for commands or completion categories that should always pop
;; up the completions' buffer.  It circumvents the default method of
;; waiting for some user input (see `mct-minimum-input') before
;; displaying and updating the completions' buffer.
(setq mct-completion-passlist
      '(;; Some commands
        Info-goto-node
        Info-index
        Info-menu
        vc-retrieve-tag
        ;; Some completion categories
        imenu
        file
        buffer
        kill-ring
        consult-location))
#+end_src

The manual provides a comprehensive list of known completion categories:

*** Persist live completion for dynamic completion tables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:21788d38-c916-4a36-93fd-6695776d954f
:END:

Quoting from the documentation of the ~mct-persist-dynamic-completion~
user option:

#+begin_quote
When non-nil, keep dynamic completion live.

Without any intervention from MCT, the default Emacs behavior for
commands such as ~find-file~ or for a ~file~ completion category is to hide
the =*Completions*= buffer after updating the list of candidates in a
non-exiting fashion (e.g. select a directory and expect to continue
typing the path).  This, however, runs contrary to the interaction model
of MCT when it performs live completions, because the user expects the
Completions' buffer to remain visible while typing out the path to the
file.

When this user option is non-nil (the default) it makes all non-exiting
commands keep the =*Completions*= visible when updating the list of
candidates.

This applies to prompts in the ~file~ completion category whenever the
user selects a candidate with ~mct-choose-completion-no-exit~,
~mct-edit-completion~, ~minibuffer-complete~, ~minibuffer-force-complete~
(i.e. any command that does not exit the minibuffer).

The two exceptions are (i) when the current completion session runs a
command or category that is blocked by the ~mct-completion-blocklist~ or
(ii) the user option ~mct-live-completion~ is nil.

The underlying rationale:

Most completion commands present a flat list of candidates to choose
from.  Picking a candidate concludes the session.  Some prompts,
however, can recalculate the list of completions based on the selected
candidate.  A case in point is ~find-file~ (or any command with the ~file~
completion category) which dynamically adjusts the completions to show
only the elements which extend the given file system path.  We call such
cases "dynamic completion".  Due to their particular nature, these need
to be handled explicitly.  The present user option is provided primarily
to raise awareness about this state of affairs.
#+end_quote

*** Deprecation of mct-region-completions-format
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:3f04e53d-c0bf-481e-861d-46511ef37265
:END:

The ~mct-region-completions-format~ used to be the only user option that
affected the ~mct-region-mode~.  It was removed in the interest of
simplicity and to avoid potential complications or bugs.  Having
separate user options for ~mct-minibuffer-mode~ and ~mct-region-mode~ would
inevitably lead to duplication and a considerable expansion of the code
base with all sorts of exceptions and checks.

In-buffer completion now uses the same ~mct-completions-format~ as its
minibuffer-based counterpart.

*** Deprecation of regexp for name of Completions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e40c90cc-3d65-4623-80fc-160df5cb540b
:END:

There used to be a user option ~mct-completion-windows-regexp~ which
targeted the name of the =*Completions*= buffer.  This was legacy code
from the early days of the code base: there is no reason to provide a
customisation of this sort.  The ~defcustom~ has been converted into a
~defvar~ so anyone who still needs the feature can access it:
~mct--completions-window-name~.

** Sorting the completions on Emacs 29
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4e7f9589-a5c0-426a-98ae-6e4c3ade6531
:END:

Starting with commit =a46421446f= to emacs.git (by me) users have the
option to control how the completions are sorted: the variable is
~completions-sort~.  Its default value is the same as before, namely, a
lexicographic order, though it accepts an arbitrary function.

The mct manual provides samples of such functions (improvements are
always welcome):
<https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct#h:493922c7-efdc-4b63-aa96-b31c684eb4fa>.

Or evaluate:

: (info "(mct) Sort completion candidates on Emacs 29")

For your convenience:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Some sorting functions...
(defun my-sort-by-alpha-length (elems)
  "Sort ELEMS first alphabetically, then by length."
  (sort elems (lambda (c1 c2)
                (or (string-version-lessp c1 c2)
                    (< (length c1) (length c2)))))))

(defun my-sort-by-history (elems)
  "Sort ELEMS by minibuffer history.
Use `mct-sort-sort-by-alpha-length' if no history is available."
  (if-let ((hist (and (not (eq minibuffer-history-variable t))
                      (symbol-value minibuffer-history-variable))))
      (minibuffer--sort-by-position hist elems)
    (my-sort-by-alpha-length elems)))

(defun my-sort-multi-category (elems)
  "Sort ELEMS per completion category."
  (pcase (mct--completion-category)
    ('nil elems) ; no sorting
    ('kill-ring elems)
    ('project-file (my-sort-by-alpha-length elems))
    (_ (my-sort-by-history elems))))

;; Specify the sorting function.
(setq completions-sort #'my-sort-multi-category)
#+end_src

Remember to check the manual for all known completion categories.

** Changes to the manual
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e0a18893-eaa7-4805-baa4-b238ac80f2ad
:END:

+ The documentation has been overhauled to better present its
  contents. User options now have a parent section while each of them
  occupies its own node, making it easier to find exactly what one
  needs.

+ There is a workaround on how to circumvent the known issue where
  ~global-hl-line-mode~ overrides the mct highlight.  Thanks to Tomasz
  Hołubowicz for the feedback in issue 1 over at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/mct/issues/1>.

+ A node is included which explains that mct uses the remap mechanism
  for specifying key bindings when it is appropriate.  As this can lead
  to unexpected issues in certain user configurations, the manual
  explains how to resolve any conflict.  Thanks to Daniel Mendler for
  the feedback on the matter (done in various threads).

+ Users of both =mct= and =corfu= packages may experience a conflict.
  Daniel Mendler (Corfu's developer) provided a snippet which is covered
  in the Corfu's README as well as the mct manual on how to address the
  potential issue: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/16>.

+ The =emacs-mct= package for Guix is now covered in the section about
  installing mct.  Thanks to Andrew Tropin and Nicolas Goaziou for
  making it happen: <https://issues.guix.gnu.org/53812>.

** Bug fixes and other refinements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:688a7b6e-683c-4687-b6b7-2f7227eee1fb
:END:

+ The timer which controls when the Completions' buffer is displayed or
  updated now cancels any outdated constructs instead of creating new
  ones.  In other words, it is optimised.  Thanks to Daniel Mendler for
  the patch which was sent via email and is recorded as commit =4ce1004=.

+ Version =0.4.1= fixed a regression with an out-of-bounds motion when
  performing certain motions in the =*Completions*= with a numeric
  argument.

+ Version =0.4.2= addressed a regression where ~mct-region-mode~ would fail
  to perform live updates.  Thanks to Z.Du for reporting the bug in
  issue 17: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/17>.

+ Motions in the Completions buffer are now always based on the
  candidate rather than the line.  The old design would fail to identify
  the first (topmost) candidate if its text was prefixed by entries that
  were not part of the completion table, such as icons provided by the
  =all-the-icons-completion= package.

+ The command ~mct-keyboard-quit-dwim~ (bound to =C-g= by default) now works
  properly with the ~mct-region-mode~.  Thanks to James Norman Vladimir
  Cash for the contribution in merge request 5:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/5>.

+ The ~mct-highlight-candidate~ no longer hardcodes colour values and
  instead inherits from the ~highlight~ face.  This makes things easier
  for themes (if you use the =modus-themes= package (by me), mct is now
  affected by the option =modus-themes-completions=).  Thanks to Tomasz
  Hołubowicz for the side note about this face in issue 1 over at the
  GitHub mirror: <https://github.com/protesilaos/mct/issues/1>.

+ Cycling the completion candidates no longer fails when the one at
  point consists of empty spaces and/or newlines.  Thanks to Tomasz
  Hołubowicz for reporting the bug in issue 2 over at the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/mct/issues/2>.

** Minibuffer Confines Transcended (aka mct-region-mode)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6ee71a37-cada-43af-93b3-a1d65e2be4a8
:END:

Emacs distinguishes between two types of completion: one that involves
the minibuffer and another for text expansion inside regular buffers.
MCT has supported the former case since its inception, as hinted by its
original name ("Minibuffer and Completions in Tandem"), but would not
work as intended for in-buffer completion.

This changes with the introduction of a new global minor mode:
~mct-region-mode~.  What once was ~mct-mode~ is now defined as
~mct-minibuffer-mode~ to better denote the scope of the given
functionality.

With ~mct-region-mode~ enabled, users get a simplified subset of the
familiar MCT functionality when typing =TAB= or =C-M-i= to complete the
text-at-point in any major-mode that supports
~completion-at-point-functions~ (e.g. programming modes or Org).

~mct-region-mode~ is considered experimental and unstable.  Users are
encouraged to report any bugs as well as recommend ways to improve its
functionality or interaction model.  The manual has been updated to
cover all the relevant details.

Daniel Mendler, who is the developer of the =vertico= and =corfu= packages
(alternatives to ~mct-minibuffer-mode~ and ~mct-region-mode~, respectively),
was intstrumental in making ~mct-region-mode~ happen.  Daniel's patches
helped with everything from (i) the proper functioning of
~mct-region-mode~, (ii) the separation between ~mct-minibuffer-mode~ and
~mct-region-mode~, (iii) the overall setup of the minor modes, and (iv)
lots of other crucial details of the overall design of MCT.  In short:
there would be no ~mct-region-mode~ without Daniel's contributions.  Any
remaining errors or omissions are my own.

Given this new functionality, we can now joke that "MCT" stands for
"Minibuffer Confines Transcended".

* Version 0.3.0 on 2021-11-19

** MCT on Emacs 27
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c05100f7-a525-4d76-8f88-8de4cfe69e67
:END:

+ MCT now works on Emacs 27.  This was not possible in the past because
  ~mct-mode~ was originally designed to operate with the =one-column= style
  of the ~completions-format~, which was added in Emacs 28.  To make
  everything behave intuitively, several parts had to be abstracted and
  refactored (the changelog of version =0.2.0= (further below) covers
  everything not mentioned here).

+ The scenaria where the functionality was thoroughly tested involve all
  the available formats and cover commands that fulfil the following
  criteria:

  - Plain completion candidates, as in ~switch-to-buffer~.
  - Dynamic completion like that of ~find-file~.
  - Annotated candidates, as seen in ~describe-symbol~ for versions of
    Emacs 28 or higher.
  - Commands where candidates are grouped by heading, as done by various
    extensions of the =consult= package, such as ~consult-imenu~.
  - Commands where no completion category is associated with them.

+ The only change which is visible to the user is the implementation
  of a bespoke overlay to highlight the current candidate.  In
  previous versions, this was provided by the built-in ~hl-line-mode~,
  though that does not work as intended with either the =vertical= or
  =horizontal= layouts of the ~completions-format~ as it covers the whole
  line instead of the candidate at point.

+ The highlight extends to the edge of the window when the =one-column=
  format is used for the ~completions-format~ (Emacs 28 or higher).  In
  the other views it stretches from the beginning to the end of the
  completion candidate.

+ Thanks to Case Duckworth for the initial request and subsequent
  testing in issue 1: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/1>.

** Miscellaneous changes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:db448e8b-5416-4561-993a-4f5f3a8ad7e4
:END:

+ There is a new command that is active in the minibuffer which allows
  to complete and exit immediately: =C-RET= (~mct-complete-and-exit~).  This
  economises on key presses when all the user wants is to select the
  top-most candidate (or last highlighted one) without first switching
  to the Completions' buffer and then confirming it from there (=RET= in
  the =*Completions*= buffer completes and exits directly).

  - Thanks to José Antonio Ortega Ruiz for the contribution in merge
    requests 3 and 4 as discussed in issue 8:

    + <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/3>
    + <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/4>
    + <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/8>

  - Note that "exit" in this context denotes the process of terminating
    the session while accepting the current input.  The term used to
    quit without accepting the input is "abort".

+ The ~mct-mode~ does not get activated in contexts where (i) the
  minibuffer is involved but (ii) no completion takes place.  For
  example, the ~eval-expression~ command (bound to =M-:= by default).

+ ~mct-mode~ no longer remaps the faces of the ~display-line-numbers-mode~.
  This was a useful experiment from the early days of the code base,
  although it is bad practice for a user-facing package.

+ Various tweaks and refinements to the manual.

+ Retroactive introduction of a CHANGELOG.org file and coverage of all
  noteworthy changes hitherto.

This entry describes the changes to Minibuffer and Completions in Tandem
(mct) since the release of [[#h:a4b2152a-96e2-46fc-b9e0-ba223028118f][version 0.1.0 on 2021-10-22]].  There have been
70 commits since then.  For further details, please consult the manual
online: <https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct>.  Or evaluate the following
expression if you have the =mct= package installed:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(info "(mct) Top")
#+end_src

** Packaged version of MCT
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0fb1fb23-636f-41f3-97bf-880d83ac42e0

=mct= is now available on the official GNU ELPA archive for users of Emacs
version 28 or higher.  One can install the package without any further
configuration.  The following commands shall suffice:

#+begin_src
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET mct
#+end_src

** Changes to the format and placement of the Completions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:97eba994-45ad-4f86-945f-a60772f764b5
:END:

+ The user option ~mct-live-completion~ controls how and when the
  Completions' buffer should be placed in a window and be updated live
  in response to user feedback.  Copying from the doc string:

  #+begin_quote
  mct-live-completion is a variable defined in ‘mct.el’.

  Its value is t

  Control auto-display and live-update of Completions' buffer.

  When nil, the user has to manually request completions, using the
  regular activating commands.  The Completions' buffer is never updated
  live to match user input.  Updating has to be handled manually.  This
  is like the out-of-the-box minibuffer completion experience.

  When set to the value =visible=, the Completions' buffer is live
  updated only if it is visible.  The actual display of the completions
  is still handled manually.  For this reason, the =visible= style does
  not read the =mct-minimum-input=, meaning that it will always try to
  live update the visible completions, regardless of input length.

  When non-nil (the default), the Completions' buffer is automatically
  displayed once the =mct-minimum-input= is met and is hidden if the
  input drops below that threshold.  While visible, the buffer is
  updated live to match the user input.

  Note that every function in the =mct-completion-passlist= ignores this
  option altogether.  This means that every such command will always
  show the Completions' buffer automatically and will always update its
  contents live.  Same principle for every function declared in the
  =mct-completion-blocklist=, which will always disable both the
  automatic display and live updating of the Completions' buffer.
  #+end_quote

  - Thanks to Jonathan Irving for the feedback in issue 4:
    <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/4>.

+ As with all buffers, the placement of the =*Completions*= can be
  controlled with the ~display-buffer~ machinery.  The default is to show
  the completions at the bottom of the frame, though users can easily
  move it to, say, the left side window.  The doc string of the user
  option ~mct-display-buffer-action~ explains how to do so.

  - Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the initial implementation in commit
    =436b24e= (was sent via email as a patch).

  - Thanks to Kostadin Ninev for reporting a bug where the Completions'
    buffer would proliferate during completion:
    <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/issues/3>.  It was fixed by
    Philip Kaludercic in commit =51c1e17=.

+ MCT now supports all the available styles of the ~completions-format~,
  whereas the original design was only meant to work with the value
  =one-column=, which was introduced in Emacs 28.  The user option is
  ~mct-completions-format~.  If that variable is set with ~setq~, the
  ~mct-mode~ has to be restarted manually for changes to take effect
  (setting the variable through ~customize-set-variable~ (and related)
  handles the mode reloading automatically).

  - Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the patch in commit =b392b0b=.

  - Several changes were then made to ensure that the cyclic motions
    that move between the =*Completions*= and the minibuffer work
    intuitively in a grid view.  In short: =C-n=, =C-p= or the down/up arrow
    keys, perform a vertical motion, while the left/right arrow keys
    move laterally.  Prior to those changes, =C-n= or down arrow as well
    as =C-p= or up arrow, would perform a lateral motion as that is
    internally the meaning of the next/previous completion candidate.

  - The command ~mct-choose-completion-number~ was updated to throw a user
    error when a grid view is active.  That is because it is designed to
    jump to a given line number, which only works as intended when there
    is only one candidate per line. (Perhaps a future release should
    overlay characters over candidates in the grid view to select them
    directly.)

+ The ~mct-mode~ no longer sets the =completions-detailed= variable.  That
  is a matter of user preference.  It is not integral to the
  functionality of MCT.

** Group motions

:END:

+ Emacs 28 provides infrastructure for commands to group candidates
  based on their contents.  These groups can have their own heading in
  the Completions' buffer, as well as a separator.  Overall, it makes
  things look more organised.  The commands ~mct-next-completion-group~
  and ~mct-previous-completion-group~ move between those headings.  While
  in the =*Completions*= buffer, they are bound to =M-n= and =M-p=,
  respectively.  Thanks to James Norman Vladimir Cash for the
  contribution in merge request 2:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/2>.

** Miscellaneous changes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:ed67abef-dad3-4620-bc70-1c3dc268db59
:END:

+ The =TAB= key in the Completions' buffer never exits the minibuffer (the
  command is ~mct-choose-completion-no-exit~).  Instead, it expands the
  current candidate in the minibuffer and switches focus to it.  Before,
  this behaviour would only happen in ~find-file~ and related prompts, but
  consistency/predictability is better.

  [ By contrast, =RET= (~mct-choose-completion-exit~) in the Completions
    buffer always exits with the candidate at point. ]

  Note that in this context "exit" means to close the session and accept
  the current input.

+ There is a new heuristic to deal with commands that ~let~ bind the
  ~crm-separator~ (e.g. ~org-set-tags-command~ sets the separator to =:=).
  This is used to make =M-RET= (~mct-choose-completion-dwim~) in the
  Completions buffer work in all ~completing-read-multiple~ contexts.
  Thanks to James Norman Vladimir Cash for contributing the heuristic in
  merge request 1:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/mct/-/merge_requests/1>.

+ The aforementioned =M-RET= command used to have the same effect as =RET=
  when not in a ~completing-read-multiple~ prompt ("CRM prompt").  This
  has now been revised to behave like =TAB= instead (as described further
  above), which is consistent with the ordinary behaviour of =M-RET= in
  CRM prompts where it appends the candidate at point to the minibuffer
  without exiting.

+ The check for ~display-line-numbers-mode~ tests whether it is bound,
  thus avoiding possible errors.  Thanks to Philip Kaludercic for the
  patch in commit =6bd2457=.

+ Made several improvements to doc strings and various snippets of code.

** Updates to the manual

+ A sample setup is available for =mct= as well as several built-in
  options pertaining to the minibuffer.

Initial release.  The mct.el file derived from the now-deprecated
prot-minibuffer.el (part of [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles][my dotfiles]]), which I had been using for
more than six months full time.
